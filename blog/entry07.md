###### Takeaway about The Expo Elevator Pitch

* I was able to make eye contact with the judges
* Telling them about my website

Overall, I would say that I have enojyed working and being sep in start and the end of the year. I have learned a lot from my teacher, Mr.Mueller. I would like to mostly said yes to my friends like Kiara, Xue, Katherine and other more from different classes to help me. Without them, I would always be stuck and won't understand anything.
