### Why did i choose cooking?

I choose cooking because ever since I was a little girl, I would always watch my dad make food for the whole family to eat because He was a chef but now that he has retired as a chef, but he's just a homecook dad now and he makes cooking fun and tells me to help him and throughout the years of helping him. I been inspired to cook or become a chef like him in the future because he makes it looks interesting and I also find it fun and inpsiring from his skills. And this website is talking about [Day in a life of a Chef.](https://www.cordonbleu.edu/news/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-chef/en) There are also [many types of different chefs](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/359/types-of-chefs.html) 

### Engineering Design Process

We have to first define the problem as if for step 1. Step 2, we have to research the problem and the more research that we find the more inofrmation that we can find and get. But aka researching. Last week we had to pick 3 topics that we find interesting or the ones that really caught our attention. Then we have to pick our 1st topic and we have to write about what waas interested about it. But for now I'm just working on finding my researching aka Step 2 because I want to make my topic interesting and make it seem like they should take it seriously. I am almost there to moving to Step 3 but I am still researching , but before I move on, I will mostly still be working on researching and finding more information for now.
