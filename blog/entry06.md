### Context
----

- Using A-frame and Thinking about I would be able to use it for 
- Thinking about how I would be able to do with my tool 
- Using Resources from youtube videos to help me understand. what I would be able to do 
- Desigining my A-frame

#### How did I make my MVP?

How I made my MVP was about how I was able to use a template from the free bootstrap templates. Then I would also be able to make some changes and trying to change the colors but then there were some problems about the using the template and trying to change the color. I was trying to make the template change colors and then when I was trying to change the cards due to the cards being a bit different than my wireframe.   

First, I searched up on google, free bootstrap template and I would click on the link called [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/). Which I had to scroll down to find and then I was able to find a template that I would want to use.

Then after picking my template that I wanted to use and then I would designed my wireframe and taking some inspirsation from the template and using some other bootstrap tools like the compents which shows where I would get the cards to use it for images and then adding the images to the templates.  

And then most for lastly, I was able to make some changes but there were still changes that still needs to be made. For example, the color is still the same from the template but it would mostly look very similiar to the original template. So now I would try to make the changes from colors and the designs and trying to make it a bit more advance.  

This was it looks now:

<img width="930" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-15 at 12 46 59 PM" src="https://github.com/caronv3030/sep10-freedom-project/assets/146861646/820ea2bb-5c70-48dc-8875-5dab6b1edc4f">

So now I have to try and work and making the changes on the colors which would make it to the color that I have to. Which would be very diffcult due the the code on the template seems to have a lot which maybe one impact of error would mess the whole template up. 

### Sources
--- 
The Sources that I would be using to help me with A-frame was using their [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) and using a [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mETucqeOmXA&t=377s) video that was teaching me how to use A-frame and what I can do it. For example, putting the shapes and moving to where you would want to install it or place it. Which I would still trying to reseacrh to change the colors on the template.

### Skills
---
What I have learned from using A-frame so far is about how I am able to make my own VR website and how kinda easy it is to use. You can make models and adding to them to your VR webiste. Even though, it would be challenging, I feel like it would be able to help me how to visual my website more and how I would be able to make it look for realistic and how much can visiual and see my point of view.

### Summary
---

While I was trying to test out the A-frame and trying to brainstorm and starting to plan out my website. It was kinda hard and easy at the same time, I was able to understand how to move the shapes, changing background colors, adding shapes, changing shapes size and height. But I'm still brainstorming and working how to make these work for it to look like what I would have in my mind. But thanks to my sources, I would be able to use them to help me and finding out what they would be able to look like and a more visuial website.
