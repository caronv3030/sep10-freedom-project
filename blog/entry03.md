#### Context

What I am talking about on my Blog 3 is about me brainstorming Part B and having to finalize all my context so then it would be ready for me to make it into a website.

#### Brainstorming my Part B

(Brainstorming is something to think about like your topic and what kind of like changes within your topic or thinking about what you will be needing within your topic or contribute your ideas)

* ### Making a better cooking app  
  - telling you recipes
  - telling you how long you would have to cook for
  - what temperature it needs to be
  - the ingredients

* ### Different kinds of cooking gadgets
  (Cooking gadgets are what chef uses to help them with preparation of a single kind of dish or performing one specific function across a variety of dishes or easy gadgets that can change their lifes!.) 
  ##### For exmaple:
  - StoveSelf Magnetic Shelf for Kitchen Stove  
  - A Measuring Cup (To tell you what you need to measure the amount you would need) 
  - A Temperature thermometer (Tells you the temperature so then you can see if its the right temperature that you would need to be on 

* ### Different Cooking Devices/ Appliances
  (Cooking devices are something that you are going to use when you are using them to make or prepare a meal withing a dwelling unit) 
  - A Revoultion Cooking 2-Slice High Speed Smart Toaster 
  - Best Smart MugEmber Temperature Control Smart Mug 2 
  - Ninja CREAMi Ice Cream Maker
 
About my Part B, it is mostly about making a better cooking app, cooking gadgets and cooking device and appliances thay you would be able to be using in the future. I'm making this into like a webiste because if you like search up like "**Cooking Gadgets and Cooking Devices/Appliances**" then you can clearly find one of your topics other than what else you would want to search them up together. 

#### Resources 
* [Cooking Gadgets](https://www.thespruceeats.com/best-kitchen-gadgets-4174050) 
* [Cooking Device/ Appliances](https://www.housebeautiful.com/shopping/home-gadgets/g22826031/smart-kitchen-appliances/)
  I got these information from [Google](https://www.google.com/?safe=active&ssui=on) and which has taken me a while to find but thankfully I was able to find some of them and they were able to give me the information that I needed. All I did was typing on the Google search was **_Cooking Gadgets_** and then I typed **_Cooking Devices/Appliances_**.
