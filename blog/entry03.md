### Context
---

What I am talking about on my Blog 3 is about me brainstorming Part B and having to finalize all my context so then it would be ready for me to make it into a website.

#### Brainstorming my Part B About my Website: 
* ### Making a better cooking app  
  - telling you recipes
  - telling you how long you would have to cook for
  - what temperature it needs to be
  - the ingredients

* ### Different kinds of cooking gadgets
  (Cooking gadgets are what chef uses to help them with preparation of a single kind of dish or performing one specific function across a variety of dishes or easy gadgets that can change their lifes!.) 
  ##### For example:
  - StoveSelf Magnetic Shelf for Kitchen Stove  
  - A Measuring Cup (To tell you what you need to measure the amount you would need) 
  - A Temperature thermometer (Tells you the temperature so then you can see if its the right temperature that you would need to be on 

* ### Different Cooking Devices/ Appliances
  (Cooking devices are something that you are going to use when you are using them to make or prepare a meal withing a dwelling unit) 
  - A Revoultion Cooking 2-Slice High Speed Smart Toaster 
  - Best Smart MugEmber Temperature Control Smart Mug 2 
  - Ninja CREAMi Ice Cream Maker
 
About my Part B, it is mostly about making a better cooking app, cooking gadgets and cooking device and appliances thay you would be able to be using in the future. I'm making this into like a webiste because if you like search up like "**Cooking Gadgets and Cooking Devices/Appliances**" then you can clearly find one of your topics other than what else you would want to search them up together. 

#### Resources 
* [Cooking Gadgets](https://www.thespruceeats.com/best-kitchen-gadgets-4174050) 
* [Cooking Device/ Appliances](https://www.housebeautiful.com/shopping/home-gadgets/g22826031/smart-kitchen-appliances/)
  
I got these information from [Google](https://www.google.com/?safe=active&ssui=on) and which has taken me a while to find but thankfully I was able to find some of them and they were able to give me the information that I needed. All I did was typing on the Google search was **_Cooking Gadgets_** and then I typed **_Cooking Devices/Appliances_**.

### Engineering Design Process (EDP)
---
We are now on Step 3, **_Brainstorming_**. Brainstorming is something to think about like your topic and what kind of like changes within your topic or thinking about what you will be needing within your topic or contribute your ideas or possible solutions to your problem if you do.  After Step 3 about **Brainstorming**, it would be about the **Plan** which that is on Step 4. 

### Skills 
---
What I have learned is like is about looking into the webpage more because if you don't look closer at your information, then how can you be able to know if your information is truth are false. What I did was researching the topic like *Cooking Gadgets* and w3hen i get the information that i would need. I would use 2 websites to see if it would get 2 different information about cooking gadgets, then it would be their opinion are different or that the information may be false. But this would be how I would know if the information that I'm using truth or false...or just the website's opinion...

### Summary
---
When I was brainstorming about my topic, on Cooking, The resources that we were getting from the information. Brainstorming about my topic took me a while but then it had me thinking about my problem. now I can resolved my problem and now that I have resolve my problem. The information that I have solves a couple of problems. With the information that I have, I can basically use that informations to make my future website. And I hope that in The future i can really make a website for cooking.
