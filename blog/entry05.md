### Some Context/Learning my New tool(A-frame)
----

I learned A-frame and how to tinker from my [last blog](https://github.com/caronv3030/sep10-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry04.md). It would be like talking about how you can make your website look like more visual and interesting.
But I'm still slowly learning how to use A-frame and trying to visual what I would be making on the website.

#### What Am I Trying to Use A-frame for?

* My website for the freedom project to make it more interesting and visual
* To Know how to make cool models for my topic (Cooking)
 For example:

[A-frame's website](https://aframe.io/)

Their website shows how they were using A-frame and how it was very cool and how they also have models in there that would move like the moving clouds, which it seems very interesting and caught my interest. 

### Sources
----  
The Sources that I would be using to help me with A-frame was using their [website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) and using a [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mETucqeOmXA&t=377s) video that was teaching me how to use A-frame and what I can do it. For example, putting the shapes and moving to where you would want to install it or place it. 

Before the changes and I got this example from the A-frame webiste:

[Before and I got the code from the Website](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/mellow-maddening-neptune?path=index.html%3A12%3A14)

After the changes from the youtube video:

---
There were some changes made from the before and after, I used the youtube video & website to help me make it into one and it has helped and tells me about the changes. I changed the background colors, The floor width and height, adding shapes and moving them on top on the other shape. 

### Skills
----
What I have learned from using A-frame so far is about how I am able to make my own VR website and how kinda easy it is to use. You can make models and adding to them to your VR webiste. Even though, it would be challenging, I feel like it would be able to help me how to visual my website more and how I would be able to make it look for realistic and how much can visiual and see my point of view.

### Summary
----
While I was trying to test out the A-frame and trying to brainstorm and starting to plan out my website. It was kinda hard and easy at the same time, I was able to understand how to move the shapes, changing background colors, adding shapes, changing shapes size and height. But I'm still brainstorming and working how to make these work for it to look like what I would have in my mind. But thanks to my sources, I would be able to use them to help me and finding out what they would be able to look like and a more visuial website.
