### Some Context/Learning my New tool(A-frame)

I learned A-frame and how to tinker from my [last blog](https://github.com/caronv3030/sep10-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry04.md). It would be like talking about how you can make your website look like more visual and interesting.
But I'm still slowly learning how to use A-frame and trying to visual what I would be making on the website.

#### What Am I Trying to Use A-frame for?

* My website for the freedom project to make it more interesting and visual
* To Know how to make cool models for my topic (Cooking)
 For example:

[A-frame's website](https://aframe.io/)

Their website shows how they were using A-frame and how it was very cool and how they also have models in there that would move like the moving clouds, which it seems very interesting and caught my interest.
