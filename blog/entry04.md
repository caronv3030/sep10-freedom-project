# Entry 4
##### 2/17/24

#### Context
---
What I'm going to talk about for blog 4 is about using and tinkering my new tool, and my tool is using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)! and which can make my website look more interesting and gets more attention to it!

###### What is A-Frame?

- **A-Frame** is based on a top of HTML, which can make it simple to get things started and how it's not a core that would have such powerful entity-component framework with would provide a declarative, extensible and composable.

- **A-Frame** can also support very popluar VR sets such as Vive, Rift, Windows Mixed Reality, Cardboard, Oculus Go and it would be even used for augmented reality.

- It's like a virtual V.R (Virtual Reality) but the only thing is that it's a WebVR. A WebVR is a webite where you can see like 3D Shapes and you can move it around.

For example: [A Example of what the WebVR looks like!](https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/helloworld/)

#### Features about A-frame

- Vr Made Simple
- Declaravite HTML
- Entity-Componet ARcitecture
- Cross-Platform VR
- Performance
- Visual Inspector
- Componments
- Proven and Scalable

##### How did I tinker A-Frame?
It was very challenging at first me to understand what it was about and how to tinker and starting to get a hang of A-Frame. 

#### Steps on How I Tinkered to Use A-Frame

1. Once I got on the front page of the A-Frame website, You could see a big buttion that would say "Get Started" on the right side of your screen.

2. Which once you are on the Introduction, you can see the code for the example I putted in **What is A-Frame**.

3. Then next, I used [JSbin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output), and I deleted the code from jsbin and I copy and paste the code from the beginning from the A-frame and you can see the out-come when you paste the code into the JSbin.

Before:

After:

These were showing me that how these codes would make these codes very different before and after the changes in the photos. Before it was empty but on the aFter you can see that it has a base for the shapes.

### Sources:

(Ones that are about WebVR and which ones I would find very interesting and is giving me inspiration just brainstorming of what I would want my future website to going to look like.)

- There are several examples in A-Frames, When you see the [Showcase](https://aframe.io/showcase/#), You would be able to see the **Showcase** which you can also see that there are many example for you to look like.

  (I loved how we were able to pick the song and there was a lot of music where you can choose from and when you picked the music, you get to go on like a rollercoaster ride which I found it very fun and interesting and I would feel like I'm in a roller coaster too.)
  
* [Soundboxing WebVR by Eric Florenzano & Supermedium](https://webvr.soundboxing.co/)

(How this had a lot of details to the WebVR and it was also like you can also pick your own song that they give you too!)

### Engineering Design Process (EDP)
---
I would say like we would be in Step 3 because we are still brainstorming around our project and how we were using trying to use a new tool which can make many things change for your website. Like for example, I'm using A-Frame which can make my project look very more interesting and very visual. But soon enough I would get to Step 4 soon but now, I would say that I'm still brainstorming.

### Skills
---
What I have learned about this new tool, **A-Frame** is about how you can make a virutal VR website and it could also be used for like VR Headset which is very interesting as it seems like many people who had used VR sets and they would use A-Frame to make games or websites they would be able to visit or play around with. When I checked out both the webistes of the WebVR, they seem like it would be very challenging but it would be something I would want to do and try. And they have something thats similar, they are both music games or websites so maybe, I can make a cooking website because my project is about cooking!

### Summary
---
While tinkering with A-Frame and brainstorming about how I would create my website for using it, it would seem to very challenging but very interesting. I'm brainstorimg about the new tool and my topic which would make things a bit more hard but more fun the better. But thanks to the sources, I have a clue about what I would want to make for my future website!
