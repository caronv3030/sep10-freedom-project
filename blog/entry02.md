### Context

What I have found from the software and hardware technologies that I have found about cooking: 

#### Software  
##### (Software coding is like a coding data or program that are used to be operatuted in computers and execute specifc tasks)

* [Cooking Software](https://www.dvo.com/cooking-software.html)  

* [A Example about the Recipes about the Software, Enter Your Recipes Easily Using Quick-Fill](https://www.dvo.com/organizing-recipes.php)  

* [Type Ingredients You Have On-Hand to Get Recipe Ideas](https://www.dvo.com/recipes-on-hand.php)  

#### Hardware  
##### (Hardware is external and internal devices and equipements that you could peform the input, output, storage, communication, and processing.) 

* [Cooking Hardware](https://medium.com/@theroots006/what-is-kitchen-hardware-and-what-does-it-do-for-your-home-c9a8ac916d5d)

* [Examples of Cooking Hardware](https://resto-support.lightspeedhq.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038228214-About-Kitchen-hardware-) 


##### Google searching
How I found these informations were by searching up like "Software Cooking technology" and "Hardware Cooking technology", and then after trying to research for these information, I would look at them closely to see if they were good enough to be used in for my reseacrh. I'm suprised that you can barely find anything thats hardware cooking technology, and there is way more of Software than Hardware when I say this. 


##### Resources
I would also get these information by going to ***[HSTAT Library Databases Or Web Resources](https://sites.google.com/hstat.org/hstat-library/home)***, This was another way that I would get my information from. I would also put "Software Cooking" and then I would put "Hardware Cooking". This was another way that I would show and get information. But Moving, forward, How about what steps I am currentally in EVD.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

We are still in Step 2, ***Researching***. Researching is important because if you don't do your research, how can you get your information. Without your research and information on what you are learning about it, would definely be more diffcul for you to understand what you could be writing. Once we are done with Step 2, we would have to do Step 3, which we could have to do in Blog 3. But in Step 3, we could have to brainstorm what we will have to do it of the problems and we would have to find the solution. 

## Skills

What I have learned is how to research and how to use google properly. Like when I was researching, I could find any good enough information, which means that if I didn't have any more information then how would it possbile for anyone to understand what I am trying to tell them if I didn't have any proof of evidence. But then I used different sources search terms and trying to make it more specific. Which this has helped find more information, and resources for my topic, Cooking!


## Summary

I'm more interested onto my topic, because the software and hardware about cooking, is very shocking and seems interesting for me. And which makes me what to focus on it more, and hopefully that if I wanted to used Software or Hardware, I could use Software because then that's how I would use to make my future recipe book on the website. Hardware is for another story but I feel find it enjoyable. And really hopes that I can make a website in the future!
