### Context

What I have found from the software and hardware technologies that I have found about cooking: 

#### Software  
##### (Software coding is like a coding data or program that are used to be operatuted in computers and execute specifc tasks)

* [Cooking Software](https://www.dvo.com/cooking-software.html)  

* [A Example about the Recipes about the Software, Enter Your Recipes Easily Using Quick-Fill](https://www.dvo.com/organizing-recipes.php)  

* [Type Ingredients You Have On-Hand to Get Recipe Ideas](https://www.dvo.com/recipes-on-hand.php)  

#### Hardware  
##### (Hardware is external and internal devices and equipements that you could peform the input, output, storage, communication, and processing.) 

* [Cooking Hardware](

How I found these informations were by searching up like "Software Cooking technology" and "Hardware Cooking technology", and then after trying to research for these information, I would look at them closely to see if they were good enough to be used in for my reseacrh. I'm suprised that you can barely find anything thats hardware cooking technology, and there is way more of Software than Hardware when I say this. 

I would also get these information by going to ***[HSTAT Library Databases Or Web Resources](https://sites.google.com/hstat.org/hstat-library/home)***, This was another way that I would get my information from. I would also put "Software Cooking" and then I would put "Hardware Cooking". This was another way that I would show and get information. But Moving, forward, How I got my Sources.
